        "* We've already worked with a method: **main**\n",
        "* We know it is a **static** method.  Which we also know means that we can invoke it (use it) without creating and instance of the class (object).  This means static methods run faster.  They are generally used as utilities.  For simple methods that take variables, do some processing, and do not rely on other class behaviors, static methods are the way to go.  We will be using **public static** methods here for easy demoing purposes.  Please note that many of the methods you write out in the wild (industry) will not be public static, and that the way you call a public static method is different than the way you call other kinds of methods.  \n",
        "* The keyword **void** is used for methods that do a thing instead of returning a thing, like main running all the code inside it, or like `System.out.println()`, that prints your output.\n",
        "* Otherwise, the data type returned is specified in place of void, for example: `double` in **public static double addFloat(double x, double y)**.  \n",
        "   * In this case the method is public and static, meaning it can be called by other classes (public), without creating a new instance of the class (static).\n",
        "   * It takes two **doubles** as **input** (**arguments**), which are internally assigned to the variables **x** and **y**.  **x** and **y** have meaning and value within the method, but not outside it, similar to **i** in a for loop.\n",
        "   * It **returns** a **double**.\n",
